            <h3>About me</h3>
            <p> I recently started learning HTML, Css, JS. I really liked the opportunity to create websites and be independent of the location (you can work remotely), and earn enough to travel and have nothing to deny yourself)) I want to become a
                high-level specialist in the field of development, and most importantly, I constantly go to this goals - continuous self-development and learning new things. My path began with a book ‘JavaScript for children’, then I began to study
                layout on Internet resources, make up simple pages, and got on a course ‘FrontEnd’ from the Grampus school, where we were taught to create websites from scratch. After graduating, I decided that the RS School JavaScript / Front-end
                Course would be the perfect continuation. </p>
